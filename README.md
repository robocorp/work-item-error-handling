Example is based on concept of [Task Teardown](https://robotframework.org/robotframework/latest/RobotFrameworkUserGuide.html#test-setup-and-teardown) (link mentions mainly **Test Teardown** but concept is the same for **Task Teardown**) which is a ``Robot Framework`` execution step which will be executed at the end of each task.
